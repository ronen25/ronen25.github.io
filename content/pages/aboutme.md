Hi, I'm Ronen, and I am an independent C/C++/Python developer.

The side projects I create are useful pieces of software I use on a daily basis. I strive for quality
and high maintainability, as well as practicallity and user-friendly design.

I served in the Israeli Air Force as a C/C++/Java/C# full-stack developer, discharging honorably in 2016.
I then worked at Cyren as a C++ Software Engineer (and a Tech Lead, since May 2018) until January 2019.

I am currently enrolled in the Open University of Israel, studying for a BSc. in Computer Science.

If you need me for freelance/contracting work - please contact me :-)
